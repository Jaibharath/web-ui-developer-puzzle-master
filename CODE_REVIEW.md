Would be great if we add ADA attributes (aria-label) Update in book-search in html Web Accessibility.
Would be better to share service example added a title in app component.
Would prefer using the array function, wont be big issue but for access this for a component will be helpfull which I update in book-search component
Would be better if we have checked the list of defined just in general.
Would be better if we have placeholder for undefined either image would be also an option update in reading-list.component.html.
Would be great if we use Subjects insted of Observables as Subject allow subscribers of the Subject to push back or trigger their own events on the Subject which will be handy for multiple functionalities
